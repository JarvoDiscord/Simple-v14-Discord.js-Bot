# About The Developer
Hi!
I am Jarvo, and I have been working on bots for a long time.
Since the day I was involved in making my own bots on Discord, I thought it would be time to help others as well with making their very own very simple Slash Command bot, and so the reason I made this repo for you guys to just look and learn (Or copy code)

I always tell others to not copy code from the internet, but it's your own choice. Feel free to do whatever you want to do with it.
This bot will just reply to the `/hi` command, and will say `Hello there!` in return.

It's just so you know how you can work with slash commands, and hopefully I said enough.
