# Simple-v14-Discord.js-Bot
This is a very simple Discord.js bot that uses slash commands.

To get to the basics:
- I personally like it to have the Events and commands sorted per category (As you can see), so I did it as well with this test bot.
- I also like it if you share this repo with your friends who are trying to make a bot but never succeed to make one ðŸ˜…

## How to make a package.json file?
You can simply make this file by saying `npm init` in your console.
After you did that, you need to manually install the packages by saying `npm install <package>`

# About The Developer
Hi!
I am Jarvo, and I have been working on bots for a long time.
Since the day I was involved in making my own bots on Discord, I thought it would be time to help others as well with making their very own very simple Slash Command bot, and so the reason I made this repo for you guys to just look and learn (Or copy code)

I always tell others to not copy code from the internet, but it's your own choice. Feel free to do whatever you want to do with it.
This bot will just reply to the `/hi` command, and will say `Hello there!` in return.

It's just so you know how you can work with slash commands, and hopefully I said enough.
